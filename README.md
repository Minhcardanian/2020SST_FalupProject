## **Project Overview**
- **Name:** Robot Catcher – Safety Net for Falling Objects
- **Purpose:** To prevent injuries caused by falling objects from high buildings.
- **Motivation:** Current solutions lack automation and aesthetics. The team aims to integrate **robotics and engineering** to solve this issue.

## **Technology & Components**
The project utilizes:
- **Ultrasonic and Thermal Motion Sensors** for object detection.
- **Servo Motors** for net deployment.
- **Aluminum Joints** to control net movement.
- **Arduino Uno** for system control and automation.

## **Working Mechanism**
1. **Sensors detect falling objects** within a pre-defined range.
2. **Servos activate the net** to catch the object.
3. **The caught items** are handled by building management.

## **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Circuit Complexity:** Team overcame difficulties in wiring, coding, and sensor calibration.
- **Hardware Limitations:** Adjustments were made to optimize servo movement and net deployment.
- **Testing & Accuracy:** Multiple trial runs were conducted to refine the system’s efficiency.
